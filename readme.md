# memori ✂️
The Hobonichi Techo is a "<a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/about/">Life Book</a>" with one page for each day of the year. I use mine as a daily planner, journal, and sketchbook.

This year, Hobonichi announced an official <a href="https://techoapp.1101.com/en/">Hobonichi Techo App</a>, which, among other features, lets users print photos that are perfectly sized to fit the Techo's grid paper.

Two tiny problems with this:
<ol>
	<li>
		The app is Japan-exclusive until December 2025
	</li>
	<li>
		The Memory Print feature requires a <a href="https://techoapp.1101.com/en/premium/">paid subscription</a>:
	</li>
</ol>

So here's a web app that does the same thing (and then some) for free.

## usage

Different Techo types use differently-spaced grid paper. Use the links below to select the appropriate spacing for your Techo.

| <b>Techo</b> | <b>Link</b> |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Planner A6 | [Use 4mm grid ↗](link)<br>(default) |
| Original<br>Cousin<br>HON A6<br>HON A5<br>Original Avec<br>Cousin Avec<br>5-Year Techo A6<br>5-Year Techo A5<br>Day-Free A6<br>Day-Free A5 | [Use 3.7mm grid ↗](link) |
| Weeks<br>Weeks Mega | [Use 3.55mm grid ↗](link) |

After opening memori in your web browser, drag one or more images from your desktop onto the grid.

	- or, when using a mouse, scale with `ctrl + scroll`

- hover an image and drag with two fingers to pan (set the "crop" - the part of the image that's visible)<br>

	- when using a mouse, hover an image and `scroll` to pan vertically, or use `shift + scroll` to pan horizontally

- ```⌘ + click``` an image to duplicate it<br>

Once you've filled out the page, press ```⌘ + P``` to print using your system's default print dialog:

>[!TIP]
>For best results...
>- select "Scale: 100%" rather than "Fit to page width"
>- set Margins to None or 0

Use a hobby knife and a straightedge (or regular old scissors) to cut your images to size:

Then stick 'em down with a gluestick (or try printing with sticker paper):
