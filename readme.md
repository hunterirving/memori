# memori ✂️
The Hobonichi Techo is a <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/about/">Life Book</a> with one page for each day of the year. I use mine as a daily planner, journal, and sketchbook.

This year, Hobonichi announced an official <a href="https://techoapp.1101.com/en/">Hobonichi Techo App</a>, which, among other features, lets users print photos that are perfectly sized to fit the Techo's grid paper.

One tiny problem with this:
<ul>
	<li>
		The Memory Print feature requires a <a href="https://techoapp.1101.com/en/premium/">paid subscription</a>.
	</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://techoapp.1101.com/en/premium/"><img src="readme_images/premium_plan.jpg" width=500px></a>

So here's a web app that does the same thing (and then some) for free.

## usage
Different Techo types use differently-sized grid paper. Use the links below to select the appropriate grid size for your Techo:

| <b>Techo</b> | <b>Link</b> |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Planner A6 | [Use 4mm grid ↗](https://hunterirving.github.io/memori?grid-size=4mm)<br>(default) |
| Original<br>Cousin<br>HON A6<br>HON A5<br>Original Avec<br>Cousin Avec<br>5-Year Techo A6<br>5-Year Techo A5<br>Day-Free A6<br>Day-Free A5 | [Use 3.7mm grid ↗](https://hunterirving.github.io/memori?grid-size=3.7mm) |
| Weeks<br>Weeks Mega | [Use 3.55mm grid ↗](https://hunterirving.github.io/memori?grid-size=3.55mm) |

Use scissors (or a hobby knife) to cut your images to size:

Then stick 'em down with a gluestick (or try printing with sticker paper):
